XD~~ **I am looking_Forward_ to learning a lot in cse110** ***I like programming in python3 but I can program in other languages as well. Personally, I don't have too many hobbies, since I'm not really an outdoors person, though I enjoy playing games and watching movies.*** Use `git clone` to copy code from a repository onto your computer. These are also some useful commands.
